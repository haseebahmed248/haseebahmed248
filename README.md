## Projects

- **[Poetry Management System](https://github.com/haseebahmed248/Poetry-management-System):**
  This project is centered around a comprehensive exploration of the intrinsic value embedded within design patterns and architectures in the Java programming language.

  The study delves into the nuanced interplay of these concepts, particularly within the context of Java Swing, Apache SQL, and the precise implementation of JUnit test cases. The objective is to gain a thorough understanding of how these       elements synergize to enhance the overall robustness and efficiency of software solutions.

- **[Software Unit Testing](https://github.com/haseebahmed248/UnitTesting):**
  This project demonstrates the integration of API and GUI testing using a Docker image of Metabase.
  Metabase is a powerful business intelligence tool, and by utilizing its Docker image, we can easily set up an environment for testing various aspects of the application.
